let a=2;

//Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations. Here are the most common arithmetic operators in 
console.log("Addition is "+a+b);//Addition
console.log("Subtraction is "+ (b - a));//Subtraction
console.log("Multiplication is "+a*b);//Multiplication
console.log("Division is "+a/b);//Division
console.log("Modulus is "+a%b);//Modulus
console.log("Exponentiation is "+(a**b));//Exponentiation


//JavaScript also has some shorthand operators that combine arithmetic with assignment. Here are some examples:
console.log("a += b is the same as a = a + b "+(a+=b));//Addition assignment
console.log("a -= b is the same as a = a - b "+(a-=b));//Subtraction assignment
console.log("a *= b is the same as a = a * b "+(a*=b));//Multiplication assignment	
console.log("a /= b is the same as a = a / b "+(a/=b));//Division assignment
console.log("a %= b is the same as a = a % b "+(a%=b));//Modulus assignment
