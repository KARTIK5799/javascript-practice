//Create a variable of type string and try to add a number to it.
let a="kartik";
let b=5;
console.log(a+b);

//Use the typeof keyword to see the data type of the variables in the previous question.
console.log(typeof a);

//Create a constant object in JavaScript and then try to change its value to another data type.
const a1={
    name :"kartik",
    id:2,
    attendence:true
}
//a1=43; it is not possible to change the value of constant object but we can change key values.
